<p class="message">
  Thank you for stopping by! Here's a little something about me, as well as how to reach me in case you want to drop me
  a line
</p>

Not knowing where to start to identify myself, I have decided to start from the vary basic fact that qualifies most of us
today: what we do for a living. I am a teacher of English as a foreign language as well as a student of American
literature at the University of Venice, Italy. 

I have not always been into the Anglo-american side of things, but I have pretty much always been into languages and the
humanities. In a previous life I was a student of Mandarin Chinese (i.e. 中文 the language) and Chinese "culture" (i.e. history,
classical texts, phylosophical/religious traditions, etc.). But then things changed and got more complicated, so here I
am now.

Some things close to my <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> include:

* [Anti-specieism](https://anti-speciesism.com), and more generally the blurring or total removal of division lines.
* [Sea Shepperd](https://seashepherd.org), awesome people who work for a better, blue life.
* [LAV](https://www.lav.it), more awesome people who pressure the Italian government to offer protection to the
  non-humans.
* [A/I](http://autistici.org), the (very few and struggling) people who still allow for some freedom and privacy on the internet today.
* [Herman Melville](https://www.melvillesociety.org/aboutthesociety), no introductions needed. 


Finally, here's my email address, in case you wish to get in touch: <br />

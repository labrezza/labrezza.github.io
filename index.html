    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog.
    </p>

      <p>My plan as I'm starting this blog is to write about everything and anything I'm interested in, and hopefully engage in a conversation with you.
     If you wish to get to know me better, or get in touch, you can visit the <a href="/about">about page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for reading!
    </p>
